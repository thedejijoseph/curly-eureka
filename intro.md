### i started a new data analytics course a couple days ago

we're still at the start of the course and already intentional about building a project portfolio.

first is a simple exercise:

- determine a topic
- ask a question
- identify data what will be needed
- identify sources of such data

i've got two topics/questions in mind

#### #1
topic: product development; question: what are indicators of successful product

number 1 is important to me because of my work as a product manager. it's important for me to know who my competitors are and to understand what contributes to their success

#### #2
topic: public health; question: what are the common illnesses in rural areas of South-West Nigeria

number 2 is aligned to my work as part of a non-profit whose mission is to advocate for inclusive healthcare
