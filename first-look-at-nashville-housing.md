i came across this portfolio yesterday: https://github.com/tiannaparris/Data-Analysis-Portfolio

and it gave me the idea to do something similar for Lagos state. answer the question: what are the most expensive areas in lagos state?

other questions/features could include:

- filtering by accommodation type, number of rooms, etc

i'm about to import data into tableau for the first time
